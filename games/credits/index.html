          <p class="center">EPISODE I<br />
            The orgin story</p>
      
          <p>It al started with an idea from Sven van Straalen</p>
      
          <p>He wanted to build an arcade cabinet. So he started to pitch his idea to all kind of managers within Capgemini DCX FS where eventually Jelle, Hans and Wouter came to the conclusion this was an epic idea and we have to build it</p>
      
          <p>Now Sven needed a team of developers so he pitched his idea @ the coding nights where some epic developers wanted to join this awsome journey into coding space!</p>
      
          <p>The developers are:</p>

          <p>Eduard Wu</p>

          <p>Hans Blum</p>

          <p>Wesley Delpeut</p>

          <p>Juan and a tricky lastname</p>

          <p>Bart Altena</p>

          <p>Ricardo van der Hijden</p>

          <p>Marijn van der Steen</p>

          <p>And they all started developing and fisicly building the arcade cabinet to make it into the full glory what it is now today!</p>
      
          <p>There are some great titles like phaser league where you are plaing foodball with freaking cars and doing some others stund all from topdown in 2D extremely amazing</p>
      
          <p>Or the burning man where you have to run as hard as you can because else you will catch fire. Everthing can happen dont forget to get the red pill to make everthing safe</p>
      
          <p>Or the Galagy invaders where you have to kill bug's before they enter your Galagy but watch out they will shoot back. The game idea is never seen before and is nothing similar like space invaders never heard of it</p>
      
          <p>And this all in ONE arcade cabinet&hellip;</p>
